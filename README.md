# Karamoja Food Security Monitoring Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents an *interactive Tableau dashboard* that monitors food security in *Karamoja, Uganda. It combines **population data* and *agricultural yield data* to provide insights into food availability and demand across districts and sub-counties.  

## Objectives
- Import and clean external datasets in Tableau.  
- Join *Population* and *Yield* data on District and Sub-county.  
- Build an *interactive dashboard* with maps, charts, and filters.  
- Highlight trends and challenges affecting food security in Karamoja.
  
## Data Sources
- *Population Dataset* – Sub-county and district-level population figures.  
- *Yield Dataset* – Agricultural production statistics by crop type.  

## Methodology
1. Imported .csv datasets into Tableau.  
2. Cleaned and standardized fields (districts and sub-counties).  
3. Performed joins between *Population* and *Yield* datasets.  
4. Designed dashboard visuals: maps, bar charts, and trend lines.  
5. Added filters for *year, district, and crop type*.  

## Dashboard Features
- *Map view* – Population and yields by district.  
- *Bar charts* – Crop yields by sub-county.  
- *Trend lines* – Yield changes over time.  
- *Interactive filters* – User-friendly exploration of data.
- 
## Key Insights
- Population growth is uneven across Karamoja.  
- Some districts show declining yields in staple crops.  
- Areas with stable yields may indicate agricultural resilience.
